# SteganographyApplication
Application which uses steganography to hide messages into audio and graphic files.
# How it works
My application uses LSB(Least Significant Bit) method. It's all about replacing least significant bits from carrier file with those from message we want to hide.
# What can you do
Application lets user to hide different types of messages e.g. simple text files (.css, .html, .json...), audio files, video files, graphic files and simple text messages into audio files (.wav) and graphic files. One can e.g. hide python script into image and send it to someone. 
# What do you need to run application
Now application is not deployed, you will need Visual Studio to run the project. Once the application is deployed you will just need to type url address into browser, it works like other web applications.
